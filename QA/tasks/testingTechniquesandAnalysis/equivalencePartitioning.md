## Task: Equivalence Partitioning for User Registration

**Context:**

You are responsible for testing the user registration functionality of a web application. The registration form includes fields for Personal Information (First Name, Last Name) and Sign-in Information (Email, Password, Confirm Password).

**Objective:**

Apply Equivalence Partitioning to design test cases for the user registration form. Ensure that you cover different classes of inputs for each field and consider both valid and invalid scenarios.

**Instructions:**

1. **First Name and Last Name:**
   - Class 1: Valid names with standard characters (example, "Test", "te").
   - Class 2: Invalid names with special characters or numbers (example, "Test", "D@te").
   - Class 3: Edge cases – very short names and very long names.

2. **Email:**
   - Class 4: Valid email addresses (example, "user@example.com").
   - Class 5: Invalid email addresses without "@" or with incorrect format (example, "invalid-email", "user@.com").
   - Class 6: Edge cases – very short and very long email addresses.

3. **Password:**
   - Class 7: Valid passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers (example, "Secure123").
   - Class 8: Invalid passwords that are too short or too simple (example, "short", "123456").
   - Class 9: Edge cases – very short and very long passwords.

4. **Confirm Password:**
   - Class 10: Matches the password entered in the Password field.
   - Class 11: Does not match the password entered in the Password field.

**Deliverables:**

- Create a table similar to the one provided in your solution, outlining each test case, the input for each field, and the expected outcome.
- Write a brief explanation for each class, justifying the inclusion of the chosen test cases.

**Note:**

Consider the principles of Equivalence Partitioning to minimize the number of test cases while ensuring comprehensive coverage of possible scenarios. Test both the positive and negative cases to validate the robustness of the registration form.
