### Security Testing

**Explanation:**

Security testing is a type of non-functional testing that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential security risks in a software application. The goal is to ensure that the software protects sensitive data, user privacy, and system integrity, safeguarding against potential security threats and attacks.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - **Objective:** Identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by attackers.
   - **Key Concepts:** Conducting code reviews, static analysis, and vulnerability scanning.

2. **Penetration Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, providing insights into the effectiveness of security measures.
   - **Key Concepts:** Ethical hacking, exploiting known vulnerabilities, and identifying potential attack vectors.

3. **Authentication Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Verify the effectiveness of user authentication mechanisms and ensure secure access controls.
   - **Key Concepts:** Testing password policies, multi-factor authentication, and session management.

4. **Authorization Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Assess the software's authorization mechanisms to ensure that users have appropriate access levels and permissions.
   - **Key Concepts:** Testing role-based access control, least privilege principles, and access restrictions.

5. **Data Security Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.
   - **Key Concepts:** Encryption, secure data transmission, and protection against data leaks.

6. **Input Validation Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Validate that the software properly validates and sanitizes user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
   - **Key Concepts:** Testing for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

7. **Security Configuration Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Verify that security configurations are appropriately set to minimize security risks.
   - **Key Concepts:** Reviewing server configurations, ensuring secure defaults, and addressing unnecessary exposures.

8. **Session Management Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Assess the security of user sessions, ensuring that session tokens are securely managed.
   - **Key Concepts:** Testing for session fixation, session hijacking, and session timeout controls.

9. **Cryptography Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the effectiveness of cryptographic mechanisms used for data protection.
   - **Key Concepts:** Testing encryption algorithms, key management, and secure storage of cryptographic keys.

10. **Security Logging and Monitoring:**
    - **Objective:** Ensure that the software logs security-related events and activities and has monitoring mechanisms in place.
    - **Key Concepts:** Reviewing logs, setting up alerts for suspicious activities, and monitoring for security incidents.

11. **Secure File Handling:**
    - **Objective:** Verify that the software handles files securely, preventing unauthorized access or execution.
    - **Key Concepts:** Checking for file upload vulnerabilities, file permissions, and secure file storage.

12. **Security Patching:**
    - **Objective:** Ensure that the software is regularly updated with security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
    - **Key Concepts:** Keeping software dependencies up-to-date, monitoring security advisories, and applying patches promptly.
