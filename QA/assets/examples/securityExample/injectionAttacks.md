**Explanation:**

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Input Validation:** Properly validating and sanitizing user inputs is crucial to preventing SQL injection. Input validation ensures that user-provided data conforms to expected formats and is safe for use in SQL queries.

2. **Parameterized Queries:** Parameterized queries or prepared statements are a secure way to interact with databases. They separate user inputs from SQL code, preventing attackers from injecting malicious code.

3. **Attack Techniques:** Understanding common SQL injection attack techniques, such as union-based, time-based blind, and error-based injections, is essential for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.

4. **Database Privileges:** Limiting the privileges of the database user used by the application helps minimize the potential damage an attacker can cause if they successfully inject SQL.

**Example:**

1. *Boolean-Based SQL Injection:*

```
Explanation:
Suppose a web application has a login form with username and password fields. An attacker enters the following input into the username field:
Input: `admin' OR '1'='1`

Key Concepts:
1. Input Validation: The input is not properly validated, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
2. Attack Techniques: This is an example of a classic SQL injection using the `'1'='1'` condition to bypass authentication.

Example:
The attacker's input modified the query to:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'password';`

Since `'1'='1'` always evaluates to true, the attacker gains unauthorized access as if they were the 'admin' user, without knowing the password.
```

2. *SQL Injection with Comment-Based Filtering:*

```
Explanation:
Suppose a web application has a login form with username and password fields. An attacker enters the following input into the username field:
Input: admin' --

Key Concepts:
1. Input Validation: The input is not properly validated, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
2. Attack Techniques: This is an example of SQL injection using the comment (--) symbol to comment out the remainder of the query.

Syntax:
SQL injection occurs when user inputs are manipulated to inject malicious SQL code. In this case, the attacker used the comment (--) symbol to disable the remainder of the query.

Example:
The attacker's input modified the query to:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'password';

The comment (--) symbol causes the query to ignore everything after it. As a result, the query effectively becomes:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';

The attacker gains unauthorized access without needing a valid password.
