# Test Closure

- **Test Completion Check:** All 200 planned test cases have been executed. No pending or blocked test cases remain.

- **Test Metrics Collection:** Out of the 200 test cases, 180 passed, 15 failed, and 5 were not applicable. A total of 20 defects were found, out of which 15 were fixed and retested successfully. The remaining 5 defects were deferred to the next release due to their low impact and complexity.

- **Test Documentation:** All test documentation, including test plans, test cases, and bug reports, have been updated and stored in the project repository for future reference.

- **Test Deliverables:** The following deliverables have been prepared for handover to the stakeholders:

  - Test Case Document: Contains the details of all the test cases.

  - Test Scripts: Automated test scripts used during testing.

  - Bug Reports: Detailed reports of the defects found during testing.

  - Test Summary Report: A summary of the testing activities and results.
  
  - Test Metrics: Detailed metrics about the testing process.

  - Release Note: A document detailing the contents of the release.

  - Sign-off Document: A document indicating formal closure of the testing phase.

- **Sign-off:** The testing phase for the project has been formally closed. The software has met the defined quality standards and is ready for release.

Test Closure is typically done at the end of a testing phase, which could be at the end of a sprint in an Agile development environment, or at the end of the project in a more traditional Waterfall model.

In Agile, a Test Closure would be done at the end of each sprint to ensure that all testing activities for the features developed in that sprint have been completed and any defects found have been logged and prioritized for fixing.

In a Waterfall model, Test Closure would typically be done at the end of the project, once all features have been developed and all rounds of testing (like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing) have been completed.
