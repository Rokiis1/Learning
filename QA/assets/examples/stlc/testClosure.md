# Test Closure

- **Test Completion Check:** All 200 planned test cases have been executed. No pending or blocked test cases remain.

- **Test Metrics Collection:** Out of the 200 test cases, 180 passed, 15 failed, and 5 were not applicable. A total of 20 defects were found, out of which 15 were fixed and retested successfully. The remaining 5 defects were deferred to the next release due to their low impact and complexity.

- **Test Documentation:** All test documentation, including test plans, test cases, and bug reports, have been updated and stored in the project repository for future reference.

- **Test Deliverables:** The deliverables outlined in the Test Plan have been prepared for handover to the stakeholders. Please refer to the "Deliverables" section in the Test Plan for details.

- **Sign-off:** The testing phase for the project has been formally closed. The software has met the defined quality standards and is ready for release.

Test Closure is typically done at the end of a testing phase, which could be at the end of a sprint in an Agile development environment, or at the end of the project in a more traditional Waterfall model.

In Agile, a Test Closure would be done at the end of each sprint to ensure that all testing activities for the features developed in that sprint have been completed and any defects found have been logged and prioritized for fixing.

In a Waterfall model, Test Closure would typically be done at the end of the project, once all features have been developed and all rounds of testing (like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing) have been completed.

Test Metrics in a Test Plan: These are typically predictive metrics. They are used to plan and estimate the testing activities. They might include metrics like the estimated number of test cases, the projected defect density, or the expected test coverage.

Test Metrics in Test Closure: These are typically retrospective metrics. They are used to evaluate the testing activities after they have been performed. They might include metrics like the actual number of test cases executed, the actual defect density, the actual test coverage, or the number of defects found and fixed.

Test Metrics in a Test Plan are about what you expect to happen, while Test Metrics in Test Closure are about what actually happened. Comparing these metrics can provide valuable insights into the accuracy of your estimates and the effectiveness of your testing process.
