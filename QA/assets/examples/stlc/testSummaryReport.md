A Test Summary Report can be written at the end of each sprint or at the end of the project, depending on the testing methodology and the needs of the team.

In an Agile development environment, it's common to write a Test Summary Report at the end of each sprint. This allows the team to review the testing results, identify any issues, and make improvements in the next sprint. It also provides stakeholders with regular updates on the testing progress and the quality of the software.

In a traditional Waterfall development environment, the Test Summary Report is usually written at the end of the testing phase, before the software is released. This report provides a comprehensive summary of all the testing activities and results.
