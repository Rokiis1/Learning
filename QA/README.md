- [White-Box Test Techniques](#white-box-test-techniques)
- [Experience-based Test Techniques](#experience-based-test-techniques)
- [Collaboration-based Test Approaches](#collaboration-based-test-approaches)

## Black-Box Test Techniques

- [Equivalence Partitioning](#equivalence-partitioning)
- [Boundary Value Analysis](#boundary-value-analysis)
- [Decision Table Testing](#decision-table-testing)
- [State Transition Testing](#state-transition-testing)

**Explanation:**

Black-box testing is a software testing technique that focuses on assessing the functionality of a software application without examining its internal code or structure. Testers, in this approach, treat the software as a "black box," and their main concern is to verify if the inputs produce the expected outputs without knowledge of the internal workings of the system. Various test techniques are employed to ensure thorough testing of different aspects of the software.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **No Knowledge of Internal Code:**
   - Black-box testers do not have access to the internal code, architecture, or design of the software under test. They focus solely on inputs and outputs.

2. **Functional Testing:**
   - Black-box testing primarily involves functional testing, where the software's functions are tested by providing inputs and examining the corresponding outputs.

3. **Test Cases Based on Requirements:**
   - Test cases are designed based on the software requirements and specifications. The goal is to verify that the software meets its specified functionality.

4. **Test Design Techniques:**
   - Various test design techniques are used to create effective test cases. Examples include equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, state transition testing, and decision table testing.

5. **Equivalence Partitioning:**
   - Inputs are divided into groups or partitions, and test cases are designed to represent each partition. This helps ensure that the software behaves consistently across different input ranges.

6. **Boundary Value Analysis:**
   - Test cases are designed to evaluate how the software behaves at the boundaries of input ranges. This is important as defects often occur at the edges of input domains.

7. **State Transition Testing:**
   - Applicable for systems with distinct states. Test cases are designed to verify the transitions between different states and the correct behavior in each state.

8. **Decision Table Testing:**
   - A systematic method for testing combinations of inputs by creating a table that represents all possible combinations of input conditions and corresponding actions.

### Equivalence Partitioning

**Explanation:**

Equivalence Partitioning is a black-box testing technique that divides the input domain of a software application into classes of equivalent inputs. The goal is to reduce the number of test cases while ensuring that the selected test cases effectively represent different scenarios. The underlying concept is that if a system behaves correctly for one input within an equivalence class, it should behave correctly for all inputs within that class.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Equivalence Class:**
   - An equivalence class is a set of input values that are treated the same way by the system. Testers identify these classes to reduce the number of test cases.

2. **Partitioning:**
   - The input domain is divided into different partitions or classes. Each partition represents a set of inputs that should exhibit similar behavior.

3. **Representative Test Cases:**
   - Test cases are selected from each equivalence class to represent the entire class. If a test case from a specific class works correctly, it is assumed that other values in the same class will also work.

4. **Invalid Equivalence Classes:**
   - In addition to valid equivalence classes (inputs that should be accepted), testers also identify invalid equivalence classes (inputs that should be rejected or produce errors).

7. **Efficiency:**
   - Equivalence partitioning is an efficient testing technique as it helps reduce the number of test cases needed to cover a broad range of scenarios.

8. **Applicability:**
   - This technique is particularly applicable when there is a large set of possible input values, and testing all combinations is not feasible.

9. **Requirements-Based:**
   - Equivalence partitioning is closely tied to the software requirements. The identified equivalence classes align with the expected behavior outlined in the requirements.

10. **Error Detection:**
    - The technique is effective at detecting errors related to the handling of different types of inputs and their respective classes.

**Example:**

### Tasks: Equivalence Partitioning

- [Tasks: Equivalence Partitioning](./tasks/testingTechniquesandAnalysis/equivalencePartitioning.md)

### Boundary Value Analysis

**Explanation:**

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a black-box testing technique that focuses on testing values at the boundaries of input domains. The objective is to identify errors that may occur at the extremes of the input range, where the behavior of the system is likely to change. By testing values at these boundaries, testers aim to ensure the robustness and reliability of the software, as defects often manifest near the limits of acceptable input values.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Boundary Values:**
   - Test cases are designed to evaluate the behavior of the system at the boundaries of valid input ranges. These boundaries include the minimum, maximum, and points immediately before and after these limits.

2. **Input Domain:**
   - BVA is applied to the input domain of a function or feature. This could include numerical ranges, date ranges, character lengths, and other parameter constraints.

3. **Three-Partition Rule:**
   - The input domain is divided into three partitions: values below the lower bound, values within the valid range, and values above the upper bound. Test cases are then designed for each of these partitions.

7. **Focus on Invalid Inputs:**
   - While BVA primarily focuses on valid input boundaries, it also considers values immediately outside the valid range to test the system's response to invalid inputs.

**Example:**

- [Example: Boundary Value Analysis](./assets/examples/testingTechniquesAndAnalysis/boundryValueAnalysis.md)

### Decision Table Testing

**Explanation:**

Decision Table Testing is a black-box testing technique used to design test cases that cover different combinations of input conditions and their corresponding actions or outcomes. It is particularly useful when a system's behavior is influenced by multiple conditions or rules, and the interactions between these conditions need to be thoroughly tested. Decision tables provide a structured way to represent complex business rules and ensure comprehensive test coverage.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Decision Table Components:**
   - **Conditions (Inputs):** Represent the various factors or input conditions that influence the system's behavior.
   - **Actions (Outputs):** Indicate the expected outcomes or actions based on combinations of input conditions.

2. **Rules:**
   - Each row in the decision table represents a unique combination of input conditions and their corresponding outcomes. These combinations are often referred to as rules.

3. **Columns:**
   - The decision table consists of columns for each condition and action. It provides a visual representation of the relationships between conditions and actions.

4. **Condition States:**
   - Conditions can have different states, typically denoted as "true," "false," or "don't care" (indicating that the condition's state does not matter for a specific rule).

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Decision tables can include boundary conditions to test the system's behavior at the edges of acceptable input ranges.

**Example:**

- [Example: Decision Table Testing](./assets/examples/testingTechniquesAndAnalysis/decisionTableTesting.md)

### Tasks: Decision Table Testing

### State Transition Testing

**Explanation:**

State Transition Testing is a black-box testing technique that focuses on testing the behavior of a system as it transitions between different states. This technique is particularly applicable to systems with distinct states, where the behavior and functionality can change based on specific events or conditions. The primary goal of state transition testing is to ensure that the system transitions correctly between states and behaves as expected in each state.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **States:**
   - A state represents a condition or situation in which a system exists at a specific point in time. The system's behavior and functionality may vary depending on its current state.

2. **Events:**
   - Events trigger state transitions. An event is an occurrence that causes the system to move from one state to another. Events can be internal or external.

3. **Transitions:**
   - Transitions describe the movement of the system from one state to another in response to an event. The transitions are governed by specific rules or conditions.

4. **State Diagram:**
   - A state transition diagram is often used to visually represent the different states, events, and transitions within a system. It provides a clear and concise view of the system's behavior.

5. **Actions:**
   - Actions are the activities or operations that the system performs when it transitions from one state to another. Each transition may be associated with specific actions.

6. **Conditions:**
   - Conditions define the criteria that must be met for a particular state transition to occur. These conditions may be based on the current state, event, or external factors.

7. **Test Cases:**
   - Test cases for state transition testing are designed to cover different combinations of events and current states, ensuring that the system transitions correctly and performs the expected actions.

- **Defect Reporting and Tracking**: During test execution, defects or issues are identified and reported to the development team. A defect tracking system is used to manage and monitor the status of these reported defects until they are resolved.

- **Test Closure**: Test closure marks the end of the testing phase. It involves evaluating whether all functionalities have been tested, no new defects are found, testing schedules are met, and there are no project risks related to testing.

## Test Case vs Test Case Report

1. **Test Case:**

- **Purpose:** A test case is a detailed document that outlines the specific steps to be followed, the conditions to be met, and the expected outcomes to verify a particular aspect of a software application.

- **Content:** Test cases include information such as test case ID, test steps, input data, expected results, preconditions, and postconditions. They are used by testers to execute tests systematically.

- **Focus:** Test cases are focused on the specific actions to be taken during testing and the expected results, helping testers ensure that the software functions correctly.

2. **Test Case Report (or Test Execution Report):**

- **Purpose**: A Test Case Report, often referred to as a Test Execution Report, provides an overview of the status and results of executed test cases for a specific testing phase or cycle.

- **Content**: Test Case Reports typically include project details, test phase information, test execution dates, the total number of test cases executed, the number of test cases passed and failed, details about the test environment, an overall summary of the testing effort (example overall status, comments), and a list of individual test cases with their execution statuses and any specific comments.

- **Focus**: Test Case Reports focus on summarizing the outcomes of testing efforts and providing stakeholders with a high-level view of the testing progress and results. They help project managers, stakeholders, and team members assess the quality and readiness of the software.

## Defect Report (Bug Report)

**Explanation:**

Defect Reports are separate documents used to document and track issues or defects identified during testing. You do not typically write Defect Reports (Bug Reports) within individual test cases.

- Defect Reports document issues found during testing, which may result from executing test cases. These reports are used to communicate the problems to developers or the relevant team responsible for fixing the defects.

## Test Summary Report

**Explanation:**

A Test Summary Report is a comprehensive document that provides a consolidated overview of the testing activities conducted during a specific phase of a software development life cycle. It serves as a formal record of the testing process, presenting key findings, outcomes, and metrics to stakeholders involved in the project. The primary purpose of the Test Summary Report is to communicate the quality and readiness of the software being tested.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Consolidation of Testing Information:**
   - The Test Summary Report consolidates information from various testing activities, including test case execution, defect tracking, and other relevant testing processes.

2. **Communication Tool:**
   - It serves as a communication tool between different stakeholders, such as project managers, developers, quality assurance teams, and business analysts, providing them with a snapshot of the testing results.

3. **Project Overview:**
   - The report typically includes details about the project, such as the project name, test phase, and dates of testing. This contextual information helps readers understand the scope of the report.

4. **Test Execution Details:**
   - It provides details about the execution of test cases, including the total number of test cases, the number of test cases passed, and the number of test cases failed. This information indicates the level of test coverage and the overall success of the testing effort.

5. **Defect Summary:**
   - A Test Summary Report includes a summary of defects found during testing, highlighting their severity levels and current status. This section aids in assessing the impact of identified issues on the software.

6. **Test Environment Information:**
   - Details about the test environment, including the operating systems, browsers, and other relevant configurations, are often included. This information helps in understanding the conditions under which the testing was conducted.

7. **Overall Test Status:**
   - The report concludes with an overall test status, indicating whether the testing goals were achieved. The status is typically expressed as Pass or Fail, providing a clear indication of the software's readiness for the next phase.

8. **Recommendations and Next Steps:**
   - In some cases, the Test Summary Report may include recommendations for improvements or actions to be taken based on the testing outcomes. This guides future development and testing efforts.

9. **Approval and Sign-off:**
   - The report may include a section for approval and sign-off by relevant stakeholders, indicating their acceptance of the testing results and readiness to proceed with the next phase of the project.
