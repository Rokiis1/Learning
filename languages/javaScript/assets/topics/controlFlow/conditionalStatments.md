## if

The `if` statement is a fundamental control flow structure that allows the execution of a block of code based on a specified condition.

### if else

The `if-else` statement extends the `if` statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the initial condition is not met.

### if else if

The `if-else if` chain allows testing multiple conditions sequentially. The first condition that evaluates to true will execute its corresponding block of code.

## 2. Ternary Operator

The ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`) provides a concise way to write simple if-else statements in a single line.

## 3. switch case

The `switch` statement provides a structured way to handle multiple cases based on the value of an expression. It is particularly useful when there are multiple possible matches.
