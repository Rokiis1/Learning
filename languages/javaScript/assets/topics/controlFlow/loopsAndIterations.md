## while

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

## do while

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.

## for

The `for` loop is a versatile loop structure that includes an initialization, condition, and iteration expression. It is commonly used for iterating over arrays or performing a specific number of iterations.

### break

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, bypassing the remaining iterations.

### continue

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one in a loop.
