/**
 * Task 1: Basic For Loop
 * Write a JavaScript program that uses a 'for' loop to print all numbers from 1 to 10.
*/

/**
 * Task 2: For In Loop with Object
 * Create an object with some key-value pairs. Use a 'for-in' loop to loop through the object and print each key and its corresponding value.
*/

/**
 * Task 3: For Of Loop with Array
 * Create an array of your favorite fruits. Use a 'for-of' loop to iterate through the array and print each fruit.
*/

/**
 * Task 4: While Loop
 * Write a JavaScript program that uses a 'while' loop to print all even numbers from 2 to 10.
*/

/**
 * Task 5: Do While Loop with User Input
 * Write a JavaScript program that uses a 'do-while' loop for a number until they enter a negative number. After each input, print the number entered.
 */

/**
 * Task 6: Nested For Loop
 * Create a nested 'for' loop that prints a pattern of asterisks. For example, for n = 4, it should print:
 * 
 * *
 * **
 * ***
 * ****

/**
 * Task 7: Loop with Array Filtering
 * Create an array of numbers. Use a 'for' loop to iterate through the array and print only the even numbers.

 * Task 5: Extract Values from Start to End
 * This program extracts values from an original array from the 'start' index (inclusive) to the 'end' index (exclusive).
 * @param {number[]} arr - The original array from which values are extracted.
 * @param {number} start - The index from which to start extracting values (inclusive).
 * @param {number} end - The index where extraction should end (exclusive).
 * @returns {number[]} - The extracted values from the original array.

/**
 * Task 6: Remove Elements from Array
 * This program removes a specified number of elements from an array starting from a given index.
 * @param {number[]} arr - The original array to be modified.
 * @param {number} index - The index from which removal should begin.
 * @param {number} count - The number of elements to remove.
 * @returns {number[]} - The modified array with elements removed.

 * Task 7: Iterate and Display Array Elements
 * This program iterates through an array and displays each element along with its index.
 * @param {number[]} arr - The array to iterate through and display its elements.
*/

/**
 * Task 8: Copy elements from the source array to a new array.
 *
 * @returns {Array} A new array containing the copied elements.
*/
