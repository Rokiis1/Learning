```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

- Initialization: `let i = 1` initializes the loop control variable `i` to 1.

- Condition: `i <= 5` checks if i is less than or equal to 5.

- Iteration: `i++` increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

This loop will execute five times, printing the numbers 1 through 5. When `i` reaches 6 (due to the `i++` iteration 
statement), the condition becomes `false`, and the loop terminates.

You can use `for` loops for a wide range of tasks, such as iterating over arrays, processing data, or executing repetitive tasks with precise control over the loop's behavior.
