- The remote repository is where the shared codebase resides. This could be on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- The "Origin" is a common name given to the default remote repository.
- Commits represent changes to the codebase. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash).
- The arrows indicate the flow of changes from local to remote or vice versa.
- Developers clone the remote repository to their local machines to work on the code.
- After making changes, they commit those changes to their local repository.
- Pushing commits sends the changes to the remote repository.
- Pulling fetches changes from the remote repository to the local one.
- The process repeats as developers collaborate on the codebase.
