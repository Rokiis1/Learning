1. **Source Code**: Developers write their source code using frameworks like Vue, React, etc.

2. **Vite.js Dev Server**: Vite's development server serves the application during development. It supports features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast and efficient code updates.

3. **Vite Plugins (Optional)**: Developers can use Vite plugins to extend and customize the build process. Examples include adding new features, handling assets, or integrating with other tools.

4. **Transpilation**: Vite supports transpilation for languages like TypeScript and JSX, converting them into JavaScript that browsers can understand.

5. **Bundling Process**: Vite bundles the code and assets for production. It generates optimized and minified bundles for efficient delivery.

6. **Output Directory**: The bundled and optimized code is placed in an output directory, ready for deployment.

7. **Browser Sync and HMR**: During development, Browser Sync ensures synchronization across multiple browsers, and HMR allows for fast module replacement without a full page refresh.
