The Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a living document that evolves throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It starts with basic information about each requirement and gets updated as the project progresses through each phase.

The Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is typically created once at the beginning of the project and then updated throughout the project lifecycle. It's not usually created anew for each sprint.
