# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used for web development. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic elements on websites. JavaScript can be executed on both the client-side (in the web browser) and the server-side (on a web server).

## Explaination how the JavaScript works

When a user opens a website, the browser requests JavaScript files from the server. Once the files are received, the browser executes the JavaScript and manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to make changes to the website. Finally, the browser displays the website with the JavaScript changes to the user.

# ECMAScript

ECMAScript is the standardized specification for JavaScript. It defines the language syntax, features, and behavior that all JavaScript implementations should follow. ECMAScript versions are often referred to as ES5, ES6 (or ES2015), ES7, and so on.

It's important to note that JavaScript is the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript. JavaScript engines in web browsers and server-side environments adhere to the ECMAScript specification to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.

# Node.js 

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side. It provides an event-driven architecture and a rich set of built-in modules, making it suitable for building scalable network applications. Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by the Google Chrome browser.

Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the web browser, enabling developers to build server-side applications, command-line tools, APIs, and more. It provides access to various APIs for file system operations, networking, database connectivity, and other system-level tasks.
