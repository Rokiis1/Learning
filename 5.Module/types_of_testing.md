# Types of Testing

**Key Concepts:**

- **Dynamic Testing:** This involves executing the software to validate its behavior. It includes both functional and non-functional testing.
- **Static Testing:** This involves reviewing the software's documentation and code without executing the software. It includes techniques like code reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections.

## Dynamic Testing

**Explanation:**

Dynamic testing involves methods used in software development that require the execution of the software. These methods are used to validate both the functional and non-functional behavior of software, ensuring it works as expected under various conditions. They are often used in conjunction with static testing methods, which do not require executing the software.

### Functional Testing

**Explanation:**

Functional testing is performed to verify that each function of the software application behaves as specified in the requirement document.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

- **Unit Testing:** Involves testing individual components of the software. This is usually done by the developers themselves.
- **Integration Testing:** Involves testing the interaction between different software modules.
- **System Testing:** Involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** The final level of testing to verify if the system meets the customer requirements.

</details>

### Non-functional Testing

**Explanation:**

Non-functional testing is performed to check the non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability) of a software application.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

- **Performance Testing:** Checks how a system performs under a particular load. It includes load testing (where the system is tested under the expected load) and stress testing (where the system is tested under extreme loads).
- **Usability Testing:** Checks the user-friendliness of the software. It helps to improve the customer experience.
- **Security Testing (Penetration Testing):** Checks if the system is secure from external threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Ensures that the software can run in different environments (different hardware, operating systems, browsers).

## Static Testing

**Explanation:**

Static testing involves validating the code, design documents, and software requirements without actually executing the software.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback:** Getting feedback from stakeholders early and often can help catch misunderstandings or errors in the requirements or design before coding begins.
2. **Review Process Activities:** The review process typically involves planning the review, conducting the review, reporting the results, and taking any necessary follow-up actions.
3. **Review Types:** There are several types of reviews, including informal reviews, walkthroughs, technical reviews, and inspections. Each type of review has its own purpose, level of formality, and process.
4. **Checklist-based Reviewing:** Reviewers use a checklist of common errors to guide their review.
5. **Scenario-based Reviewing:** Reviewers use a set of predefined scenarios to guide their review.
6. **Static Analysis:** Tools are used to analyze code for potential errors and security vulnerabilities.
7. **Model-Based Analysis:** Models of the software (like data flow diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams) are analyzed to find errors or potential improvements.
