**Explanation:**

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) solution provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a workflow.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Workflow:** A configurable automated process that you set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any project on GitHub. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event.

2. **Action:** The smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use and customize actions shared by the GitHub community.

3. **Job:** A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can depend on each other and can run sequentially or in parallel.

4. **Step:** An individual task that can run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command.

5. **Runner:** A server that hosts an environment where a job's steps are run. GitHub hosts runners with a variety of operating systems and architectures.

6. **Event:** A specific activity that triggers a workflow. For example, activity types like pushing commits or opening pull requests can trigger workflows.

7. **Secret:** Encrypted environment variables that you create in a repository or organization. Secrets are not exposed in logs or workflow files and can be used to store sensitive data, like access tokens or credentials.

8. **Artifact:** Files that are produced during a workflow (like compiled source code, JAR files, distributables). Artifacts can be used for storage and are downloadable after a workflow is completed.
