# Server

**Explanation:**

A server, in the context of computing, is a system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In many cases, servers are powerful computers with large storage capacities and substantial processing power. They run specialized software to fulfill their roles.

Servers can be local (on the same network as the client) or remote (located in a data center and accessed over the internet, often referred to as a cloud server).
