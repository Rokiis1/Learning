## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in software development. CI/CD helps maintain the quality and stability of your codebase by automating various stages of the development lifecycle.

This repository provides a basic CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions, which is a powerful workflow automation tool offered by GitHub.

## Workflow

The workflow included in this repository follows these steps:

1. **Build**: The code is compiled and any necessary dependencies are installed.
2. **Test**: Automated tests are run to ensure the code functions as expected.
3. **Deployment**: The application is deployed to a target environment, such as a staging or production server.

To use this CI/CD setup in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the codebase to fit your project requirements.
3. Configure the deployment settings according to your target environment.
4. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Usage

Once the workflow is triggered, you can monitor its progress in the Actions tab of your repository. You'll be able to see the status of each step and any associated logs or error messages.

If any step fails, GitHub Actions will provide detailed information to help you identify and resolve the issue.

## Configuration

The configuration for the CI/CD workflow can be found in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. You can customize this file to fit your specific needs.

Make sure to update the workflow file with your own build, test, and deployment commands. Additionally, you may need to configure environment variables or other settings specific to your project.
