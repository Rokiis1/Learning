## Types of Testing

### Functional Testing

**Explanation:**

**Functional Testing:** This type of testing is performed to verify that each function of the software application behaves as specified in the requirement document. It mainly involves black box testing

**Key Concepts:**

- **Unit Testing:** It involves testing individual components of the software to ensure that they work correctly. This is usually done by the developers themselves.

- **Integration Testing:** This involves testing the interaction between different software modules to identify any inconsistencies.

- **System Testing:** This involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

- **Acceptance Testing:** This is the final level of testing where the system is tested for acceptability. It helps to verify if the system meets the customer requirements and whether the system is ready for delivery.

### Non-functional Testing

**Explanation:**

Non-functional Testing: This type of testing is performed to check the non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability) of a software application.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Performance Testing:** This is done to check how a system performs under a particular load. It includes load testing (where the system is tested under the expected load) and stress testing (where the system is tested under extreme loads).

- **Usability Testing:** This is done to check the user-friendliness of the software. It helps to improve the customer experience.

- **Security Testing:** This is done to check if the system is secure from external threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Compatibility Testing:** This is done to ensure that the software can run in different environments (different hardware, operating systems, browsers).
