## Types of Testing

### Functional Testing

**Explanation:**

**Functional Testing:** This type of testing is performed to verify that each function of the software application behaves as specified in the requirement document. It mainly involves black box testing

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

- **Unit Testing:** It involves testing individual components of the software. This is usually done by the developers themselves.

- **Integration Testing:** This involves testing the interaction between different software modules.

- **System Testing:** This involves testing the entire system as a whole meets the requirements.

- **Acceptance Testing:** This is the final level to verify if the system meets the customer requirements.

</details>

### Non-functional Testing

**Explanation:**

Non-functional Testing: This type of testing is performed to check the non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability) of a software application.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

- **Performance Testing:** This is done to check how a system performs under a particular load. It includes load testing (where the system is tested under the expected load) and stress testing (where the system is tested under extreme loads).

- **Usability Testing:** This is done to check the user-friendliness of the software. It helps to improve the customer experience.

- **Security Testing(Penetration test):** This is done to check if the system is secure from external threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Compatibility Testing:** This is done to ensure that the software can run in different environments (different hardware, operating systems, browsers).
