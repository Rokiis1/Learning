## Fundamentals of Testing

### What is Testing?

Testing in software development is the process of evaluating the functionality of a software application to find any software bugs. It checks whether the software met the requirements and identifies any defect in the software.

### QA vs QC

**Explanation:**

Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two fundamental aspects of quality management, but they serve different purposes and involve different activities.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

- **Quality Assurance (QA):** QA is a proactive process that focuses on preventing defects in the development process. It involves the implementation of systematic activities and procedures to ensure that the product meets the specified requirements and standards. QA is process-oriented and aims to improve and stabilize production and associated processes to avoid issues that lead to defects.

- **Quality Control (QC):** QC is a reactive process that focuses on identifying defects in the final product. It involves the inspection and testing of the product to ensure it meets the required quality standards. QC is product-oriented and aims to identify and correct defects in the finished product before it reaches the customer.

- **Role of a Tester:** A tester primarily engages in QC activities. They focus on identifying defects in the final product through various testing methods such as functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing. Testers ensure that the product meets the required quality standards before it is delivered to the customer.

### Test Objectives

**Explanation:**

Test objectives are the goals and outcomes that need to be achieved by testing a specific item or system. They are derived from the product objectives, requirements, and test strategy.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Documentation:** This involves requirements, user stories, designs, and code to ensure they meet the specified criteria.

2. **Finding Defects:** One of the primary objectives of testing is to find defects in the system under test.

3. **Coverage:** Test objectives often include achieving a certain level of coverage, which could be in terms of requirements, risk, functionality, code.

4. **Risk Reduction:** Testing helps in reducing the risk of failure in the production environment.

5. **Verification and Validation:** Test objectives often include verifying that the system meets the specified requirements (verification) and that it fulfills its intended purpose (validation).

6. **Regulatory Compliance:** In certain domains, complying with regulatory requirements is a key test objective.

7. **Information for Decision Making:** Testing provides information about the system, to stakeholders.

8. **Building Confidence:** Testing helps that the system would work as expected.

9. **User Satisfaction:** Ensure that the system satisfies the user's needs and expectations.

</details>

### Principles of Testing

**Explanation:**

The principles of testing are fundamental guidelines that dictate what to test, how to test, and when to test, following a rule-oriented approach.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Testing shows presence of defects:** Testing can show that defects are present, but cannot prove that there are no defects. Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but, even if no defects are found, it is not a proof of correctness.

2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible:** It's not possible to test all combinations of inputs, scenarios, and paths in the software. Instead, risk analysis, priorities, and techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning are used to focus the testing effort.

3. **Early testing:** To find defects early, testing activities should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle and should be focused on defined objectives.

4. **Defect clustering:** A small number of modules usually contain most of the defects discovered during pre-release testing, or are responsible for most of the operational failures. This is also known as the **Pareto principle**, also known as the 80-20 rule, which states that approximately 80% of the issues occur due to 20% of the modules

5. **Pesticide paradox:** If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually they will no longer find new bugs. To overcome this, the test cases need to be regularly reviewed and revised, and new and different tests need to be written to exercise different parts of the software or system.

6. **Testing is context dependent:** Testing is done differently in different contexts. For example, Android application software is tested differently from an e-commerce site.

7. **Absence-of-errors fallacy:** If the system does not fulfill the users' needs and expectations, finding and fixing defects does not necessarily improve the system. A system that is 100% bug-free is not necessarily useful to the user.

</details>

### Independence of Testing

**Explanation:**

Independence of testing refers to the concept where the testing of a software product is conducted by a person or a team that is separate and independent from the team that developed the software.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Objectivity:** Independent testing provides an objective view of the software, which helps in identifying defects that might be overlooked by the development team due to familiarity with the code.

2. **Bias Reduction:** Since the testing team is separate from the development team, it reduces the risk of bias and ensures a more thorough and impartial testing process.

3. **Specialized skills:** Independent testers often have specialized skills in testing methodologies and tools, which can contribute to a more effective testing process.

4. **Accountability:** Having a separate testing team holds the development team accountable for the quality of their work, as any defects found can be traced back to the development process.

</details>

### Errors, Defects, Failures, and Root Causes

**Explanation:**

These terms in the context of software testing to describe different aspects of problems that can occur during the development and operation of software.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Error:** An error, also known as a mistake, is a human action or decision that produces an incorrect or unexpected result.

2. **Defect:** A defect, also known as a bug, is a flaw in the system or a deviation from the expected behavior. It's the result of an error made by the people creating the software.

3. **Failure:** A failure is the result of defect during execution of the software. It's when the software doesn't do what the user expects it to do.

4. **Root Cause:** The root cause is the deepest underlying cause of a defect or a failure.

</details>

### Testing and Debugging

**Explanation:**

Testing and debugging are two steps in the software development process that work together.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Testing:** Process of executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors. The goal of testing is to ensure that the software behaves as expected and meets its requirements. It involves various types of tests such as unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests.

2. **Debugging:** Once an error has been identified through testing, debugging is the process of finding the exact location and cause of that error in the code.

</details>

### Testing Process

**Explanation:**

The testing process is influenced by the expectations of stakeholders, which include requirements for quality, performance, and functionality of the software.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **Test Planning:** This involves defining the test objectives. Depending on the context, it may include defining the scope of testing, estimating the resources required, and scheduling the testing activities.

2. **Test Monitoring and Control:** This involves the ongoing checking of all test activities and the comparison of actual progress against the plan.

3. **Test Analysis:** This involves analyzing the test basis to identify testable features and to define and prioritize associated test conditions.

4. **Test Design:** It's involves test cases and other testware. Test design answers the question “how to test?”.

5. **Test Implementation:** It includes organizing test cases into test procedures, creating manual and automated test scripts, and setting up the test environment.

6. **Test Execution:** This involves running the tests. It includes comparing actual test results with expected results, logging the test results.

7. **Test Completion:** Test completion is the last step in the software testing life cycle, where we finalize all testing activities and document the results.
