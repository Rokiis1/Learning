/**
 * Task 1: Print numbers from 1 to 10 with error handling.
 */
// Hint:
// Step 1: Implement the code within a try block.
// Step 2: Inside the try block, you can define the necessary variables and write the logic to print the numbers from 1 to 10. 
// In this case, we initialize i with the value 1 and use an if statement to check if i is less than or equal to 10.
// Step 3: Add error handling using a catch block.
// Step 4: In the catch block, you can handle any errors that might occur within the try block. 
// In this example, we log the error message to the console using console.error().
// Step 5: Include a finally block for cleanup or additional actions.

/**
 Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero with error handling.
 * @param {number} number - The number to be evaluated.
 */
// Hint:
// Step 1: Define the variables and implement the logic within the try block.
// Step 2: Inside the try block, you can define the necessary variables and write the logic to determine whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. 
// In this case, we use if...else if...else statements to perform the comparison.
// Step 3: Add error handling using a catch block.
// Step 4: In the catch block, you can handle any errors that might occur within the try block. In this example, we log the error message to the console using console.error().
// Step 5: Include a finally block for cleanup or additional actions.

/**
 * Task 3: Calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100 with error handling.
 * @param {number} sum - The sum of even numbers.
 */
// Hint:
// Step 1: Define the variables and implement the logic within the try block.
// Step 2: Inside the try block, you can define the necessary variables and write the logic to calculate the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100. 
// In this case, we use a while loop and an if statement to check if i is even and accumulate the sum.
// Step 3: Add error handling using a catch block.
// Step 4: Include a finally block for cleanup or additional actions.
