/**
 * Determines the grade based on the student's score.
 * @param {number} score - The student's score.
 * @returns {string} The grade.
 */
// Hint:
// 1. Step: Declare a variable score and assign the student's score to it.
// 2. Step: Declare a variable grade and initialize it as an empty string.
// 3. Step: Use conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score. Here's an example using a series of if-else statements:
// 4. Step: If score is greater than or equal to 90, set grade to "A".
//             Otherwise, if score is greater than or equal to 80, set grade to "B".
//             Otherwise, if score is greater than or equal to 70, set grade to "C".
//             Otherwise, if score is greater than or equal to 60, set grade to "D".
//             Otherwise, set grade to "F".
// 5. Step After the conditional statements, grade will contain the appropriate grade based on the score with console.log().

// 2 Task.
/**
 * Displays a message based on the time of day.
 * @param {number} hour - The hour in 24-hour format.
 */
// Hint:
// 1. Step: Declare a variable hour and assign the hour in 24-hour format to it.
// 2. Step: Use conditional statements to determine the appropriate message based on the value of hour. Here's an example using a series of if-else statements:
// 3. Step: If hour is less than 12, set a variable message to "Good morning!".
//              Otherwise, if hour is less than 18, set message to "Good afternoon!".
//              Otherwise, set message to "Good evening!".
// 4. Step: After the conditional statements, the variable message will contain the appropriate message based on the time of day when you using console.log().

// 3 Task.
/**
 * Determines the price of a movie ticket based on the age.
 * @param {number} age - The person's age.
 * @returns {string} The ticket price.
 */
// Hint:
// 1. Step: Declare a variable age and assign the person's age to it.
// 2. Step: Declare a variable ticketPrice and initialize it as an empty string.
// 3. Step: Use conditional statements to determine the ticket price based on the value of age. Here's an example using a series of if-else statements:
//              If age is less than 13, set ticketPrice to "Child ticket price".
//              Otherwise, if age is less than 18, set ticketPrice to "Teen ticket price".
//              Otherwise, if age is less than 65, set ticketPrice to "Adult ticket price".
//              Otherwise, set ticketPrice to "Senior ticket price".
// 4. Step: After the conditional statements, the variable ticketPrice will contain the appropriate ticket price based on the age console.log().
