 * Finds a user with a specific ID in an array of user objects.
 *
 * @param {number} userId - The ID of the user to find.
 * @param {Array<Object>} users - An array of user objects.

 */
// Hint:
// 1 Step: Declare a function named findUserById that takes two parameters: userId and users.
// 2 Step: Inside the function, use the find method on the users array to search for a user object with an id property that matches the provided userId.
// 3 Step: Pass an arrow function as the argument for the find method. The arrow function should check if the id property of each user object is equal to the provided userId.
// 4 Step: If a matching user object is found, it will be returned by the find method.
// 5 Step: If no matching user object is found, the find method will return undefined.
// 6 Step: Return the user object if found or undefined if not found.
// 7 Step: Outside the function, create an example users array containing user objects with id and name properties.
// 8 Step: Call the findUserById function, passing the target userId and the users array as arguments.
// 9 Step: Store the result in a variable named user.
// 10 Step: Print the user variable using console.log().
