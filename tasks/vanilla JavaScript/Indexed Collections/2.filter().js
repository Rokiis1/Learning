/**
 * Filter users by age.
 *
 * @param {Array<Object>} users - An array of user objects.
 * @param {number} minAge - The minimum age to filter by.
 * @param {number} maxAge - The maximum age to filter by.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - An array of user objects within the age range.
 */
// Hint:
// 1 Step: Declare a function named filterUsersByAge that takes three parameters: users, minAge, and maxAge.
// 2 Step: Inside the function, use the filter method on the users array to create a new array that only contains user objects whose age falls within the given range.
// 3 Step: Use an arrow function as the argument for the filter method. The arrow function should check if the age property of each user object is greater than or equal to minAge and less than or equal to maxAge.
// 4 Step: Return the filtered array of user objects.
// 5 Step: Outside the function, create an example users array with user objects containing name and age properties.
// 6 Step: Call the filterUsersByAge function with the example users array, along with the minimum and maximum age values you want to filter by.
// 7 Step: Store the result in a variable named filteredUsers.
// 8 Step: console.log().

// Hint:
// 1 Step: Declare a function named filterProductsByPrice that takes three parameters: products, minPrice, and maxPrice.

/**
 * Filter tasks by completion status.

 * @param {Array<Object>} tasks - An array of task objects.
 * @param {boolean} completed - The completion status to filter by.
 * @returns {Array<Object>} - An array of task objects with the specified completion status.
 */
// Hint:
// 1 Step: Declare a function named filterTasksByCompletion that takes two parameters: tasks and completed.
// 2 Step: Inside the function, use the filter method on the tasks array to create a new array that only contains task objects with the specified completion status.
// 3 Step: Use an arrow function as the argument for the filter method. The arrow function should check if the completed property of each task object is equal to the provided completed parameter.
// 4 Step: Return the filtered array of task objects.
// 5 Step: Outside the function, create an example tasks array with task objects containing title and completed properties.
// 6 Step: Call the filterTasksByCompletion function with the example tasks array, along with the completion status (either true or false) you want to filter by.
// 7 Step: Store the result in a variable named completedTasks.
// 8 Step: console.log().
