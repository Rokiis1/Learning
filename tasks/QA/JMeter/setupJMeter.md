*Install Java (Pre-requisite)*
1. **Check for Existing Java Installation:**
- To verify if you already have Java installed, open a command prompt (on Windows) or a terminal (on Linux/macOS) and enter the following command:

```bash
java -version
```

2. **If Java is Not Installed:**
- If you don't have Java installed or the `java` command is not recognized, you need to install Java on your system.
- Visit the [official Oracle Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (for Oracle Java) or the [OpenJDK download page](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/) (for OpenJDK, which is a popular open-source alternative).
- Download the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) version for your operating system (example Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.
3. **Verify Java Installation:**
- After installing Java, open a new command prompt or terminal window and run the `java -version` command again. You should see the Java version information displayed, confirming that Java is now installed.

*Install JMeter*
1. **Extract the JMeter Archive:**
- Locate the downloaded archive file (ZIP or TGZ) on your computer and extract its contents to a folder of your choice. You can use built-in tools or third-party software like 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract the files.
2. **Navigate to the JMeter Folder:**
- Open the folder where you extracted the JMeter files. Inside, you'll find the JMeter executable and other related files.
3. **Start JMeter:**
- To launch JMeter, simply double-click on the `jmeter.bat` (Windows) or `jmeter.sh` (Linux/macOS) file. This will start JMeter's graphical user interface (GUI).
4. **Verify the Installation:**
- Once JMeter is running, you should see the JMeter GUI. This confirms that JMeter has been successfully installed on your computer.
5. **Optional: Add JMeter to PATH (Linux/macOS):**
If you want to run JMeter from any terminal window, you can add the JMeter bin directory to your system's PATH. To do this, open your terminal and run the following command (replace `[JMeterPath]` with the actual path to your JMeter installation folder):

You can add this line to your shell profile (as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make it permanent.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:[JMeterPath]/bin
```
