**Step 1: Launch JMeter**

Start by launching JMeter, either by running the `jmeter.bat` (for Windows) or `jmeter.sh` (for macOS/Linux) executable, depending on your operating system.

**Step 2: Create a New Test Plan**

- In JMeter, go to `File > New Test Plan` to create a new test plan.

**Step 3: Add a Thread Group**

- Right-click on the Test Plan in the left panel.
- Choose `Add > Threads (Users) > Thread Group`. This represents the group of virtual users in your test.

**Step 4: Add a Sampler (HTTP Request)**

- Under the Thread Group you created, right-click and choose `Add > Sampler > HTTP Request`. This will be the request you want to time.

**Step 5: Add a Timer**

- Under the HTTP Request sampler, right-click and choose `Add > Timer`. You can choose the type of timer you want to add:

**Constant Timer**:
- Select `Constant Timer`. You will see the timer added to the HTTP Request.
- In the Timer's configuration, set the "Thread Delay" field to the desired delay in milliseconds.

**Gaussian Random Timer**:
- Select `Gaussian Random Timer`. You will see the timer added to the HTTP Request.
- In the Timer's configuration, set the "Deviation" and "Offset" fields to control the distribution parameters.
- Optionally, set "Random Delay Maximum" to limit the maximum delay introduced.

**Uniform Random Timer**:
- Select `Uniform Random Timer`. You will see the timer added to the HTTP Request.
- In the Timer's configuration, set the "Constant Delay Offset" and "Random Delay Maximum" fields to define the range of random delays.

**Step 6: Configure Sampler and Test Plan**

- Configure your HTTP Request sampler with the necessary details, such as server name, path, request method, and parameters.
- Optionally, you can add more samplers or timers to your test plan to simulate various user actions and think times.

**Step 7: Run the Test**

- Click the green "Run" button to execute your test plan.
- Observe the results in real-time using listeners (e.g., View Results Tree, Summary Report) to see the impact of the timers on your test execution.

**Step 8: Analyze Results**

- After the test completes, analyze the results to see how the timers affected the pacing and timing of your requests. You can identify delays introduced by the timers in the response times.
