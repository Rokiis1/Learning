**Method 1: Using Apache JMeter**

**Step 1: Create a New Test Plan**

- Launch JMeter.
- Create a new test plan by going to `File > New Test Plan`.

**Step 2: Add a Thread Group**

- In the Test Plan, right-click on your Test Plan's name and select `Add > Threads (Users) > Thread Group`.
- Configure the Thread Group with the following settings:
  - Number of Threads (Users): Set it to 100 (or the desired number of concurrent users).
  - Ramp-Up Period: This determines how quickly users are added. For example, you can set it to 10 seconds.

**Step 3: Add an HTTP Request Sampler for Login**

- Right-click on the Thread Group you created in Step 2 and select `Add > Sampler > HTTP Request`.
- In the HTTP Request Sampler, specify the following:
  - Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS
  - Server Name or IP: The URL of your login page (http://example.com/login).
  - Path: The path to the login endpoint (/login).
  - Method: POST (assuming login requests use HTTP POST).
  - Add any necessary request parameters, such as username and password.

**Step 4: Add a Listener to View Results**

- Right-click on the Thread Group and select `Add > Listener > View Results Tree`.
- This listener will allow you to view the results of your login test, including response times and success rates.

**Step 5: Configure Test Duration and Run the Test**

- Configure the test duration, loop count, and other settings in the Thread Group to match your testing requirements.
- Click the "Run" button in the toolbar to start the test.
- JMeter will simulate 100 users logging in simultaneously.

**Step 6: Monitor and Analyze Results**

- Monitor the results in the "View Results Tree" listener.
- Check if 100 users are able to log in without significant delays.
- Analyze response times and any potential issues.

**Method 2: Using Browser Developer Tools (Google Chrome)**
