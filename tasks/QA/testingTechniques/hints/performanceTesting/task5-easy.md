**Method 1: Using Apache JMeter**

**Step 1: Create a New Test Plan**

1. Launch JMeter.

2. Create a new test plan by going to `File > New Test Plan`.

**Step 2: Add a Thread Group**

3. In the Test Plan, right-click on your Test Plan's name and select `Add > Threads (Users) > Thread Group`.

4. Configure the Thread Group with the following settings:
   - Number of Threads (Users): Set it to the desired number.
   - Ramp-Up Period: This determines how quickly users are added. Adjust as needed.

**Step 3: Configure File Upload Test**

5. Right-click on the Thread Group you created in Step 2 and select `Add > Sampler > HTTP Request`.

6. In the HTTP Request Sampler, specify the following:
   - Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Server Name or IP: The URL of your file upload endpoint.
   - Path: The path to the file upload endpoint (/upload).
   - Method: POST (assuming file uploads use HTTP POST).
   - Add any necessary request parameters or headers for the file upload.

**Step 4: Configure File Download Test**

7. Right-click on the Thread Group and select `Add > Sampler > HTTP Request`.

8. In the HTTP Request Sampler, specify the following:
   - Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Server Name or IP: The URL of your file download endpoint.
   - Path: The path to the file download endpoint (/download).
   - Method: GET (assuming file downloads use HTTP GET).

**Step 5: Add a Listener to View Results**

9. Right-click on the Thread Group and select `Add > Listener > View Results Tree`.

10. This listener will allow you to view the results of your file upload/download test, including response times and success rates.

**Step 6: Configure Test Duration and Run the Test**

11. Configure the test duration, loop count, and other settings in the Thread Group to match your testing requirements.

12. Click the "Run" button in the toolbar to start the test.

**Step 7: Monitor and Analyze Results**

13. Monitor the results in the "View Results Tree" listener.

14. Check if file uploads/downloads meet your pass criteria (e.g., a 10 MB file should upload/download within 10 seconds).
