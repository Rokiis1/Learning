**Task 4: Form Submissions (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application you want to explore. Ensure you are using the testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Identify Forms**

2. Identify and locate forms within the application. Forms can include login forms, registration forms, contact forms, search forms, or any other type of data submission forms.

**Step 3: Understand Form Functionality**

3. Take a moment to understand the purpose and functionality of each form. Determine what data needs to be entered, and what action the form should perform upon submission.

**Step 4: Start Form Exploration**

4. Begin exploring the forms within the application. Follow these steps for each form:

   - Click on or interact with the form to open it.
   - Fill in the required fields with sample data. You can use valid data to test normal scenarios or invalid data to test error handling.
   - Submit the form according to its intended function (clicking a "Submit" button).

**Step 5: Observe Feedback**

5. After submitting each form, carefully observe the feedback provided by the application. This includes any messages, notifications, or changes to the interface.

**Step 6: Verify Form Functionality**

6. Verify that the form performed its intended functionality correctly:
   
   - For login or registration forms, check if you are successfully logged in or registered.
   - For search forms, verify if the search results are accurate.
   - For contact or feedback forms, confirm that your message or input is processed.

**Step 7: Test Error Handling**

7. If you're testing with invalid data, intentionally trigger errors to test the form's error-handling capabilities. Check if the application provides clear error messages and guidance on how to correct the issues.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

8. Document your observations, including any issues, unexpected behavior, or unclear feedback encountered during form submissions.

**Step 9: Provide Feedback**

9. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Report any issues related to form submissions and suggest improvements if necessary.

**Step 10: Confirm Success**

10. Confirm that the form submissions are working correctly, and users receive appropriate feedback based on their interactions.
