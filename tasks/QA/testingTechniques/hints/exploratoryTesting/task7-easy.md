**Task 7: Error Handling Exploration (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application you want to explore. Ensure you are using the testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Identify Potential Error-Prone Scenarios**

2. Identify and consider scenarios that may trigger errors within the application. These scenarios could include submitting incomplete forms, attempting to access restricted areas, using incorrect input formats, or other actions that typically lead to errors.

**Step 3: Execute Error-Prone Scenarios**

3. Begin exploring the potential error-prone scenarios one by one. Follow these steps for each scenario:

   - Perform the action or input that is likely to trigger an error.
   - Observe the application's response and any error messages or feedback provided.

**Step 4: Verify Error Messages**

4. Verify the error messages displayed by the application. Ensure that they are clear, informative, and explain the nature of the error. The error messages should guide users on how to correct the issue.

**Step 5: Check System Behavior**

5. Examine how the application handles errors in terms of system behavior. Ensure that the application gracefully handles errors without crashing or exposing sensitive information.

**Step 6: Test Recovery**

6. In scenarios where errors occur, test the recovery process. Verify that users can take corrective actions to resolve the error and continue using the application without encountering further issues.

**Step 7: Document Issues**

7. Document any issues, inaccuracies, or unexpected behavior related to error handling. Provide detailed descriptions of what needs correction, and note the specific error messages encountered.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

8. Document your observations, including the behavior of the application when errors occur, the clarity of error messages, and any issues encountered during error-prone scenarios.

**Step 9: Provide Feedback**

9. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Clearly communicate any issues you identified in the application's error handling and suggest improvements if necessary.

**Step 10: Confirm Success**

10. Confirm that error messages are clear and informative, the application gracefully handles errors, and users are guided effectively in resolving issues.
