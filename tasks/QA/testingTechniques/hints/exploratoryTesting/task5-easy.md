**Task 5: Data Validation (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application you want to explore. Make sure you are using the testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Identify Input Fields**

2. Identify and locate input fields within the application. These input fields can include text fields, numeric fields, date fields, or any other form of user data input.

**Step 3: Understand Data Validation**

3. Understand the data validation rules that should be applied to each input field. Data validation rules specify what types of data are acceptable and any constraints (such as character limits or required formats).

**Step 4: Start Data Validation Exploration**

4. Begin exploring the input fields and their data validation. Follow these steps for each input field:

   - Click on or interact with the input field to activate it.
   - Attempt to enter various types of data, including valid data, invalid data, and data that might trigger specific validation rules.

**Step 5: Observe Validation Feedback**

5. After entering data into each input field, observe the feedback provided by the application. Pay attention to the following:

   - For valid data, ensure that the input is accepted without issues.
   - For invalid data that violates validation rules (entering text in a numeric field), check if the application displays appropriate error messages.
   - Verify if there are character limits, minimum and maximum value constraints, or required formats, and see if the application enforces these rules.

**Step 6: Verify Error Messages**

6. If you encounter validation errors, verify that the error messages are clear and informative. They should explain the nature of the error and suggest corrective actions.

**Step 7: Test Correction**

7. For input fields with validation errors, attempt to correct the data based on the error message guidance. Confirm that the application allows you to make corrections.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

8. Document your observations, including the effectiveness of data validation, clarity of error messages, and any issues encountered during data entry.

**Step 9: Provide Feedback**

9. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Report any issues related to data validation and suggest improvements if necessary.

**Step 10: Confirm Success**

10. Confirm that data validation is working correctly, and users receive clear feedback when entering data that does not meet validation criteria.
