**Task 9: Cross-Browser Testing Exploration (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Access the application you want to explore using your preferred web browser. Ensure that you are using a testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Browser Selection**

2. Start with the web browser that you are most comfortable with. Afterward, plan to test the application in additional browsers.

**Step 3: Explore Basic Functionality**

3. Begin by exploring the basic functionality of the application in your chosen browser. Navigate through different sections and verify that essential features work as expected.

**Step 4: Browser Switch**

4. Switch to a different web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on the same or a different device. Ensure that you clear cache and cookies if needed to simulate a fresh user experience.

**Step 5: Repeat Testing**

5. Repeat the same tests you performed in Step 3 for the new browser. Pay close attention to how the application behaves in terms of rendering, functionality, and responsiveness.

**Step 6: Visual Compatibility**

6. Check for any visual discrepancies between the browsers. Look for issues related to layout, fonts, and styling. Note any inconsistencies in how the application appears.

**Step 7: Interactivity**

7. Verify that interactive elements such as buttons, links, and forms are responsive and behave consistently across browsers. Test user interactions and form submissions.

**Step 8: Cross-Browser Compatibility**

8. Assess whether the application functions consistently across different browsers. Ensure that all features are accessible and that there are no browser-specific issues.

**Step 9: Edge Cases**

9. Test edge cases or scenarios that are specific to certain browsers. For example, test any browser-specific functionalities or plugins.

**Step 10: Document Differences**

10. Document any differences or issues you encounter while testing in different browsers. Take screenshots if necessary to illustrate discrepancies.

**Step 11: Provide Feedback**

11. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Communicate any cross-browser compatibility issues and suggest possible solutions or workarounds.

**Step 12: Confirm Success**

12. Confirm that the application works consistently and effectively across the tested web browsers. Ensure that users have a uniform experience regardless of their browser choice.

**Step 13: Optional Additional Browsers**

13. If time allows, repeat Steps 4 to 12 for additional web browsers to expand your cross-browser testing coverage.
