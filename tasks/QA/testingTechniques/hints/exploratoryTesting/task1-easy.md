**Task 1: Login Exploration (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application's login page. Ensure you are using the testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Understand the Basics**

2. Familiarize yourself with the login page's layout and elements. Take note of the fields for entering credentials, the "Login" button, and any additional elements present.

**Step 3: Start Exploration**

3. Begin exploring the login functionality by entering different combinations of usernames and passwords. Try the following scenarios:
   - Enter valid credentials (a combination that should work) and attempt to log in.
   - Enter a valid username with an incorrect password and vice versa.
   - Enter an invalid username and password combination.
   - Leave one or both fields empty and try to log in.
   - Enter special characters or long strings in the username and password fields.

**Step 4: Observe System Responses**

4. Observe how the system responds to your login attempts:
   - Check for error messages when entering incorrect credentials.
   - Verify that you receive a successful login confirmation when using valid credentials.
   - Note any unexpected behavior, such as error pages, blank screens, or unusual messages.

**Step 5: Logout and Repeat**

5. If you successfully log in, explore the user profile or dashboard if applicable. Then, log out and repeat the login process.

**Step 6: Documentation**

6. Document your observations, including any issues encountered, error messages received, or unexpected behavior. Be as detailed as possible in your notes.

**Step 7: Provide Feedback**

7. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Report any issues you discovered during your exploration.

**Step 8: Confirm Success**

8. Confirm that you were able to log in without issues and access your user profile at least once during your exploration.
