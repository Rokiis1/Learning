**Task 8: Mobile Responsiveness Exploration (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Access the application you want to explore using a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) or an emulator. Ensure that you are using a testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Orientation Check**

2. Begin by checking how the application responds to changes in device orientation (portrait and landscape modes). Rotate the device or emulator accordingly.

**Step 3: Screen Size Variations**

3. Explore the application using devices with different screen sizes. If using an emulator, select various screen sizes to simulate different devices.

**Step 4: User Interface Assessment**

4. Observe how the user interface elements adapt to the smaller screen size. Pay attention to the following:

   - Visibility: Ensure that all essential elements remain visible without excessive scrolling.
   - Touch Targets: Verify that interactive elements (buttons, links) are appropriately sized for touch interactions.
   - Text Readability: Check if text remains legible and doesn't get truncated.
   - Responsiveness: Interact with the application and assess how responsive it is to touch gestures (taps, swipes).

**Step 5: Functionality Testing**

5. Test various functionalities of the application while using the mobile device or emulator. Ensure that all features are accessible and function as expected.

**Step 6: Forms and Inputs**

6. If the application includes forms, assess how well they work on smaller screens. Test data entry, validation, and submission.

**Step 7: Scrolling Behavior**

7. Scroll through longer pages or content to assess scrolling behavior. Ensure that scrolling is smooth and that content doesn't overlap or become difficult to read.

**Step 8: Image and Media Handling**

8. If the application includes images or media, verify that they load correctly and are appropriately sized for the mobile screen.

**Step 9: Usability Assessment**

9. Evaluate the overall usability of the application on a mobile device. Consider factors such as ease of navigation, intuitiveness, and user-friendliness.

**Step 10: Documentation**

10. Document your observations, including any issues related to mobile responsiveness, user interface elements, or functionality.

**Step 11: Provide Feedback**

11. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. If you encountered any mobile responsiveness issues, communicate them clearly and suggest improvements if necessary.

**Step 12: Confirm Success**

12. Confirm that the application adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a positive user experience on mobile devices.
