**Task 6: UI Elements Exploration (Exploratory Testing)**

**Step 1: Access the Application**

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the application you want to explore. Ensure you are using the testing or staging environment if available.

**Step 2: Identify UI Elements**

2. Identify and locate various user interface (UI) elements within the application. These UI elements can include buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, sliders, and any other interactive components.

**Step 3: Understand Expected Behavior**

3. Understand the expected behavior and functionality of each UI element. This includes knowing what actions the UI element should trigger and what feedback or changes should occur when interacting with them.

**Step 4: Start UI Element Exploration**

4. Begin exploring the UI elements one by one. Follow these steps for each UI element:

   - Click on or interact with the UI element to trigger its action.
   - Observe the behavior and any changes that occur in response to your interaction.

**Step 5: Verify Functionality**

5. Verify that the UI element's functionality aligns with expectations. Ensure the following:

   - Buttons perform the intended action or navigation.
   - Checkboxes and radio buttons can be selected and deselected.
   - Dropdown menus display and allow for the selection of options.
   - Sliders adjust values as expected.

**Step 6: Check Feedback**

6. Pay attention to the feedback provided by the UI elements. This includes visual changes, pop-up messages, or any other indications that the interaction was successful or had an effect.

**Step 7: Test Boundary Cases**

7. For UI elements that involve setting values or making choices within a range (e.g., sliders or numeric input fields), test boundary cases. Verify that the UI element functions correctly at both minimum and maximum values.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

8. Document your observations, including the behavior of each UI element, any unexpected behavior, and any issues encountered during interaction.

**Step 9: Provide Feedback**

9. Share your findings and feedback with the development or testing team. Report any issues related to UI element functionality and suggest improvements if necessary.

**Step 10: Confirm Success**

10. Confirm that UI elements function as expected and provide clear feedback to users during interactions.
