**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for the use of semantic HTML elements.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Inspect Elements**

4. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Begin inspecting the HTML structure of the page. Start with the `<body>` element.

**Step 4: Check for Semantic HTML Elements**

6. Look for semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, and others.

7. Verify that these elements are used appropriately to structure the content of the web page. For example:
   
   - `<header>` should represent the introductory content or a site's header.
   - `<nav>` should represent navigation menus.
   - `<main>` should wrap the main content of the page.
   - `<article>` should encapsulate standalone content, like a blog post.
   - `<section>` should define sections of content within the page.
   - `<aside>` should represent content related to the main content but considered secondary.
   - `<footer>` should contain footer information, such as copyright or contact details.

**Step 5: Identify Non-Semantic Elements**

8. Also, look for non-semantic or generic HTML elements like `<div>` and `<span>`. While these elements can be used for layout purposes, ensure that they are not used to convey meaning or structure.

**Step 6: Make Notes of Issues**

9. If you encounter semantic HTML elements used incorrectly or missing, or if non-semantic elements are used inappropriately, take notes of the issues for further investigation.

**Step 7: Document Findings**

10. Document your findings, including any issues related to the use of semantic HTML elements and their specific locations on the web page.

**Step 8: Report and Fix Issues**

11. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve the use of semantic HTML elements and enhance accessibility.
