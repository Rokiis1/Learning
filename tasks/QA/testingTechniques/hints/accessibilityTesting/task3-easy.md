**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for keyboard navigation.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Enable Keyboard Navigation**

4. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Look for an icon that resembles a cursor or pointer inside a box (often located near the top-left corner of the developer tools panel). This icon represents "Toggle Inspect Element."

6. Click on the "Toggle Inspect Element" icon to enable keyboard navigation in the developer tools panel.

**Step 4: Navigate Using the Tab Key**

7. Press the `Tab` key on your keyboard to start navigating through the interactive elements on the web page.

8. Observe that the focus indicator (usually a blue outline or border) moves from one element to another as you press the `Tab` key. This indicates that keyboard navigation is working.

9. Continue to press the `Tab` key to navigate through links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive elements. Ensure that you can reach and interact with all of them.

**Step 5: Check for Skip Links (Optional)**

10. Look for "Skip to content" or similar skip links at the beginning of the page. Pressing this link should skip navigation links and move focus directly to the main content.

**Step 6: Test Shift + Tab (Reverse Navigation)**

11. Press `Shift + Tab` to navigate backward through the elements. Ensure that reverse navigation works as expected and that you can reach all interactive elements.

**Step 7: Make Notes of Issues**

12. If you encounter any issues with keyboard navigation, such as elements that cannot be reached or focus indicators missing, take notes for further investigation.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

13. Document your findings, including any issues related to keyboard navigation.

**Step 9: Report and Fix Issues**

14. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve keyboard accessibility.
