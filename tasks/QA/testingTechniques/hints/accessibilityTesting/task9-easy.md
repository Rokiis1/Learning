**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for keyboard-only navigation.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Enable Keyboard Navigation**

4. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Look for an icon that resembles a cursor or pointer inside a box (often located near the top-left corner of the developer tools panel). This icon represents "Toggle Inspect Element."

6. Click on the "Toggle Inspect Element" icon to enable keyboard navigation in the developer tools panel.

**Step 4: Begin Keyboard Testing**

7. Close the developer tools panel if necessary to have a clear view of the webpage.

8. Use the `Tab` key on your physical keyboard to navigate through the page's interactive elements, such as links, buttons, form fields, and menus.

**Step 5: Test Common Interactions**

9. Pay attention to common interactions, such as opening and closing menus, submitting forms, activating buttons, and navigating through content.

**Step 6: Verify Keyboard Focus**

10. Ensure that the focus indicator (usually a blue outline or border) is visible and moves sequentially as you navigate through elements. This indicates that keyboard focus is working.

**Step 7: Check for Skip Links (Optional)**

11. Look for "Skip to content" or similar skip links at the beginning of the page. Pressing this link should skip navigation links and move focus directly to the main content.

**Step 8: Test with Complex Interactions**

12. If the web page includes complex interactions (dropdown menus, sliders, modals), test these interactions with the keyboard to ensure they are accessible and functional.

**Step 9: Make Notes of Issues**

13. If you encounter any issues with keyboard-only navigation, such as elements that cannot be reached or interactions that do not work as expected, take notes of the issues for further investigation.

**Step 10: Document Findings**

14. Document your findings, including any issues related to keyboard-only navigation and their specific locations on the web page.

**Step 11: Report and Fix Issues**

15. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve keyboard accessibility.
