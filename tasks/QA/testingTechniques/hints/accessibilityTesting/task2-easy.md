**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for alt text on images.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Inspect the Images**

4. In the developer tools panel, click on the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Use the mouse pointer to hover over each image element (`<img>`) in the "Elements" tab. This highlights the corresponding image on the web page.

**Step 4: Check for Alt Text**

6. Inspect the `alt` attribute of each image in the "Elements" tab. The `alt` attribute should provide a descriptive alternative text for the image.

   - If an image does not have an `alt` attribute or has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`), it is missing alt text.

   - If an image has a meaningful and descriptive `alt` attribute, it is considered accessible.

**Step 5: Verify Descriptive Alt Text**

7. Verify that the `alt` text provides a meaningful and concise description of the image's content or function. It should convey the purpose of the image to users who cannot see it.

**Step 6: Make Notes of Issues**

8. If you encounter any images without alt text or with inadequate alt text, take notes of the issues for further investigation.

**Step 7: Document Findings**

9. Document your findings, including any images that are missing alt text or have inappropriate alt text.

**Step 8: Report and Fix Issues**

10. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve accessibility.
