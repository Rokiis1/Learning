**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for color contrast.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Inspect Text Elements**

4. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Use the mouse pointer to hover over the text elements (headings, paragraphs, links) on the web page. This highlights the corresponding text elements in the "Elements" tab.

**Step 4: Check for Color Properties**

6. Inspect the color properties of the text elements in the "Styles" or "Computed" panel within the developer tools. Look for properties such as `color` (text color) and `background-color` (background color).

**Step 5: Calculate Color Contrast**

7. Calculate the color contrast ratio between the text color and the background color. The formula for contrast ratio is:

   Contrast Ratio = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)

   Where:
   - L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter color (usually the background).
   - L2 is the relative luminance of the darker color (usually the text).

8. Use an [online contrast ratio calculator](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) or a browser extension to verify if the calculated contrast ratio meets the accessibility standard. For normal text, the minimum required contrast ratio is typically 4.5:1.

**Step 6: Identify Low-Contrast Text**

9. Identify text elements with insufficient color contrast. These are text elements where the contrast ratio is below the required threshold.

**Step 7: Make Notes of Issues**

10. If you find text elements with low contrast, take notes of the issues for further investigation.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

11. Document your findings, including any text elements with color contrast issues and their specific color values.

**Step 9: Report and Fix Issues**

12. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve color contrast and accessibility.
