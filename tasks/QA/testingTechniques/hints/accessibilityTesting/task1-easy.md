To perform accessibility testing for checking headings using web developer tools, follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for heading structure.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Inspect the Headings**

4. In the developer tools panel, click on the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Use the mouse pointer to hover over each heading element (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) in the "Elements" tab. This highlights the corresponding heading on the web page.

6. Verify that the headings are used logically and in the correct order. For example, `<h1>` should represent the main heading, followed by `<h2>` for subsections, and so on.

**Step 4: Identify Logical Structure**

7. Assess the logical structure of the page. Ensure that the heading levels follow a hierarchical order and make sense in the context of the content.

8. Check for any skipped heading levels. For example, if you see an `<h3>` followed by an `<h1>`, it might indicate an issue with the heading structure.

**Step 5: Verify Sequential Order**

9. Confirm that heading levels are used in a sequential order without any jumps or skips. For example, there should not be an `<h3>` followed by an `<h5>` without the presence of an `<h4>` in between.

**Step 6: Make Notes of Issues**

10. If you encounter any issues with the heading structure, such as incorrect ordering or missing headings, take notes for further investigation.

**Step 7: Repeat for Different Sections**

11. If the web page has multiple sections, repeat the above steps for each section to ensure consistent and logical heading usage throughout the page.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

12. Document your findings, including any issues or discrepancies you discovered in the heading structure.

**Step 9: Report and Fix Issues**

13. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve accessibility.
