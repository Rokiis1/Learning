**Step 1: Open the Web Page**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

2. Navigate to the web page you want to test for focus styles.

**Step 2: Open Developer Tools**

3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 3: Enable Keyboard Navigation**

4. In the developer tools panel, navigate to the "Elements" tab or a similar tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

5. Look for an icon that resembles a cursor or pointer inside a box (often located near the top-left corner of the developer tools panel). This icon represents "Toggle Inspect Element."

6. Click on the "Toggle Inspect Element" icon to enable keyboard navigation in the developer tools panel.

**Step 4: Test Keyboard Navigation**

7. Press the `Tab` key on your keyboard to start navigating through the interactive elements on the web page.

8. As you navigate through the elements, observe the focus indicator (usually a blue outline or border) that appears around the currently focused element.

9. Ensure that the focus indicator is clearly visible and distinct from the surrounding content. It should provide a clear visual cue about which element has keyboard focus.

**Step 5: Check for Custom Focus Styles (Optional)**

10. Some websites may use custom focus styles instead of the browser's default focus indicator. Check for custom focus styles applied to interactive elements.

11. Ensure that custom focus styles are clear and sufficiently visible. They should not rely solely on color, as colorblind users may have difficulty distinguishing them.

**Step 6: Verify Focus Styles for All Interactive Elements**

12. Navigate through various interactive elements on the page, including links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive widgets.

13. Confirm that all interactive elements consistently display focus styles when selected via keyboard navigation.

**Step 7: Make Notes of Issues**

14. If you encounter any issues with focus styles, such as missing or inadequate focus indicators, take notes for further investigation.

**Step 8: Document Findings**

15. Document your findings, including any issues related to focus styles.

**Step 9: Report and Fix Issues**

16. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve keyboard accessibility.
