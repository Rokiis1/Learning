**Step 1: Install a Screen Reader**

1. Before you begin, you'll need a screen reader software installed on your computer.
   - **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)** for Windows: [Download NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)

**Step 2: Open the Web Page**

2. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox).

3. Navigate to the web page you want to test with the screen reader.

**Step 3: Enable Developer Tools**

4. Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the developer tools panel.

**Step 4: Test with a Screen Reader**

5. Ensure that your screen reader software is running and active.

6. Use your screen reader's keyboard shortcuts to start reading the content of the web page. For example:
   - In NVDA, use `NVDA` + `Down Arrow` to start reading.

7. Navigate through the content using screen reader commands. Common commands include:
   - Moving to the next heading: `H`
   - Moving to the next link: `K` (VoiceOver) or `Tab`
   - Interacting with form fields: Follow the screen reader's instructions for interacting with forms.

**Step 5: Assess Accessibility**

8. Pay attention to how the screen reader interacts with the web page. Listen for the accurate pronunciation of text, headings, links, and other elements.

9. Ensure that the screen reader effectively communicates the purpose and function of interactive elements, such as buttons and form fields.

**Step 6: Identify Accessibility Issues**

10. If you encounter issues while using the screen reader, such as mispronunciations, skipped content, or unclear instructions, take notes of these issues for further investigation.

**Step 7: Document Findings**

11. Document your findings, including any issues related to screen reader accessibility and their specific locations on the web page.

**Step 8: Report and Fix Issues**

12. Share your findings with the development team or website owner so that any identified issues can be addressed and corrected to improve screen reader accessibility.
