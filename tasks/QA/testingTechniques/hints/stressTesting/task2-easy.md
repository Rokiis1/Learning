**Method 1: Using Apache JMeter**

**Step 1: Create a New Test Plan**

1. Launch JMeter.

2. Create a new test plan by going to `File > New Test Plan`.

**Step 2: Add a Thread Group**

3. In the Test Plan, right-click on your Test Plan's name and select `Add > Threads (Users) > Thread Group`.

4. Configure the Thread Group with the following settings:
   - Number of Threads (Users): Set it to 100 (or the desired number of concurrent users).
   - Ramp-Up Period: Set it to a reasonable value, 60 seconds. This means JMeter will gradually increase the number of concurrent users over 60 seconds.

**Step 3: Add an HTTP Request Sampler for User Registration**

5. Right-click on the Thread Group you created in Step 2 and select `Add > Sampler > HTTP Request`.

6. In the HTTP Request Sampler, specify the following:
   - Protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Server Name or IP: The URL of your user registration endpoint.
   - Path: The path to the registration endpoint (/register).
   - Method: POST (assuming registration requests use HTTP POST).
   - Add any necessary request parameters for simulating user registrations, such as username, email, and password.

**Step 4: Add a View Results Tree Listener**

7. Right-click on the Thread Group and select `Add > Listener > View Results Tree`.

8. This listener will allow you to view the results of your registration test, including response times and pass/fail status.

**Step 5: Configure Test Duration and Run the Test**

9. Configure the test duration, loop count, and other settings in the Thread Group to match your testing requirements.

10. Click the "Run" button in the toolbar to start the test.

**Step 6: Monitor and Analyze Results**

11. Monitor the results in the "View Results Tree" listener.

12. Check if the system handles at least 100 registration requests without significant errors or slowdowns.

**Step 7: Gradually Increase Load (Optional)**

13. If you want to test the system's capacity further, you can repeat Steps 2-5 with an increased number of concurrent users by creating additional Thread Groups or modifying the existing one.

14. Keep increasing the number of concurrent users until you reach the desired stress level or until the system exhibits issues or performance degradation.
